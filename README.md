## Streets of Rage-Inspired Beat'em Up Game
This is a quick gameloop demonstration made with Godot Engine 4.3 inspired by Streets of Rage (1991). I made this to learn the mechanics and structure of beat'em up games.

This project was created as a learning exercise and combines 2D visuals with 3D mechanics to create an illusion of depth while maintaining a classic pixel-art style.

I used an orthographic 3D camera and pixel assets to achieve the 2D look, however all objects are placed in a 3D world (this makes it much easier to code the jump mechanic and simulate depth on a 2D screen).
